# magebit_backend

## To start the backend:
    * Rund docker-compose up in the root folder of the project
    
    * N.B: this might fail the first time it is run because of 
    the mysql image not having credentials just run docker-compose up
     one more time and everything should work fine
     
    * Navigate to localhost:8080/get-emails
